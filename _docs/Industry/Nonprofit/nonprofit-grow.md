## Go to market with Microsoft Marketplace
The Microsoft commercial marketplace is a catalog of service or solution offers from our partners. You can create, configure, and manage offers in Partner Center. For a complete overview see [What is the Microsoft commercial marketplace](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/marketplace/overview)?

The commercial marketplace consists of two online stores:
 - [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/) for business solutions
 - [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/) for technology solutions

Multiple types of offers are supported including Consulting Services, turnkey Azure Applications, Dynamics 365 solutions, and Software as a Service subscriptions. To get started, see an overview of [Publishing guides by offer type](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/marketplace/publisher-guide-by-offer-type) to identify the type of offer most appropriate for you. Several [offer types are transactable on marketplace](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/marketplace/marketplace-commercial-transaction-capabilities-and-considerations).

If you publish a transactable offer for Azure or Teams, there are resources available to guide you from start to finish:
 - [Mastering the Marketplace](https://microsoft.github.io/Mastering-the-Marketplace/)
 - [Marketplace Office Hours](https://microsoftcloudpartner.eventbuilder.com/MarketplaceOverviewandQAforPartners)

### Offer setup considerations
To ensure your offer is visible to the right nonprofit customers consider the following settings on the Properties tab of your offer:
 - If your offer is relevant to nonprofit industry scenarios, choosing the “Nonprofit and IGO” industry will ensure that your offer appears with the industry filter:
   - [AppSource - Nonprofit & IGO Apps](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-US/marketplace/apps?exp=ubp8&filterTab=industries&industry=nonprofit)
   - [AppSource - Nonprofit & IGO Services](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-US/marketplace/consulting-services?exp=ubp8&industry=nonprofit)
 - If your offer utilizes the Common Data Model for Nonprofits or a Microsoft Cloud for Nonprofit solution like Fundraising and Engagement or Volunteer Management, check the Microsoft Clouds for Industry checkbox and choose the “Nonprofit & IGO” industry to appear on the Microsoft Cloud for Nonprofit landing page:
   - [AppSource - Microsoft Cloud for Nonprofit offers](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-US/marketplace/cloudsIndustry?exp=ubp8&industry=nonprofit)

### Co-selling your offer
