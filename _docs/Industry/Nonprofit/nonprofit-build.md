## The role of Azure for ISVs
Independent software vendors that develop and run their products on Azure see critical benefits including accelerated development and innovation, extended reach with customer access through the marketplace, and scale through partner-to-partner ecosystem selling.

For ISVs focused on our eligible nonprofit customers including nonprofits, museums, and libraries these benefits are amplified further through our own industry go-to-market activities.
