# Module 4: Data Understanding & Preparation

## Overview

Welcome to the Data Understanding & Preparation module of the EDSP mentoring program!

This module introduces the next steps of the data science process: Data Understanding and Data Preparation. This begins with 
**data profiling** to understand the current state of the data, and whether it can satisfy the business objectives of the 
project. Since data is often messy and incomplete, some **data preparation** it typically necessary for it to satisfy the 
needs of machine learning development. **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)** aims to identify the relationships existing among 
the elements (features) of the dataset along with the features that exert the greatest influence on the Target (the value being 
predicted). Since potential correlations may be obscured within the data, and because machine learning algorithms expect data
in particular formats (e.g., all numerical values), some form of **feature engineering** may be necessary to reveal the full
predictive power in the data, and to make that data satisfy machine learning requirements.
