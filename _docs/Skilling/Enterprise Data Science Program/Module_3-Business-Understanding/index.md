# Module 3: Business Understanding

## Overview

This module will guide you through setting up a AI/ML use case end-end from a business understanding & project management perspective.

### What you'll learn
How to approach and work through machine learning use cases with your customers and stakeholders to design and build soltuions.

Materials include:

- Presentation: Tackling AI projects - from idea to integration to value realization
- Excel Template: Calculate a Business Case for AI  (use for practice/reference)
- Tutorial: Real World Applications of ML that provides more case studies and examples.

## Table of Contents 

Please review the presentation and materials (the first half of presentation is covered in the recording as well).  Then the following tutorial walks through use cases and types of machine learning problems.  Don't worry too much about the specific algorithms mentioned (though if any are of interest or in your field feel free to explore those links!).  Focus primarily on the types of business problems and the high-level approaches.
