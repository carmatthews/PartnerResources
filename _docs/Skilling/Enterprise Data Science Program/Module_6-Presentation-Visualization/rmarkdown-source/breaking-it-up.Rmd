# Creating a chart by splitting it into components

---

## No chart is made completely in a single pass

* A chart is not a single **monolithic** element, so don't think of it as one

* Perhaps this thought (single element) may work for standard charts like bar charts, line charts and scatterplots because most software tools provide quick ways of creating them, with _reasonable_ defaults

* What do you do when even a basic chart or a single element is off?

--

### You split the chart into components

--

- The basic mental model is that charts are **compositional**
	- There are building blocks and ways to put them together
	- If you understand the relevant parts, you can **compose** charts by mixing and matching and layering and joining

## _Plane_ and _retinal variables_

A **plane** is like the coordinate system that defines how geometries are placed in a space. A **retinal variable** defines how to encode data into visuals.

## The Grammar of Graphics

William S. Cleveland, in his 1994 book _The Elements of Graphing Data_, lists the “basic elements of graph construction” as **scales, captions, plotting symbols, reference lines, keys, labels, panels, and tick marks**.

In _The Grammar of Graphics_, published in 2005, Leland Wilkinson built off the work by Bertin and more formally defined the components of a graphic:

Statistical graphic specifications are expressed in six statements:

| Statement | Description |
| --------|-------------|
| DATA | a set of data operations that create variables from datasets |
| TRANS| variable transformation (e.g. rank)|
| SCALE| scale transformations (e.g. log)<br/>|
| COORD| a coordinate system (e.g. polar)<br/>|
| ELEMENT| graphs (e.g. points) and their aesthetic attributes (e.g. color)<br/>|
| GUIDE| one or more guides (axes, legends, etc.)|

**Hadley Wickham implemented Wilkinson’s grammar in R with the popular `ggplot2` package.**

## Strategies for breaking charts into individual components

* The **data** drives all decisions
	- The purpose is to convey the **information** in the data  
	

* The **visual encodings** dictate the geometry and/or colors of a graphic
	- This forms the **aesthetics** of the visualization
	- This most influences how the visualization is received  
	
	
* The **coordinate system** (Cartesian, polar, or geographic) specifies the space in which the visual encodings reside.
	- This provides the canvas, scales and orientations upon which we visualize  
	
* The **context** communicates what the data is about, where it is from, and why it exists.
	- This can be provided through textual annotations, legends, etc.
