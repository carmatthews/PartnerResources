# Microsoft Teams Academy - Platform

Welcome to the platform bucket in the Teams Academy. This one is a little unique in that it focuses on Teams as a platform. You've heard of Viva, and Power Apps, and Chat bot integration wtih Teams, right? also the myriad of apps from Microsoft, others, as well as external data sources, web hooks, app policies and so on. The customization and development capabilities with Teams is vast, and extensible! This is where we will cover those types of things.
