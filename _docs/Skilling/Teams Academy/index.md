# Microsoft Teams Academy

Welcome to the _Teams Academy_, where we focus on producing and publishing videos on Microsoft Teams designed to enable our Partners to deep dive into everything Teams. This academy takes a service oriented approach to organizing the content, which is useful in identifying content to build, and makes the deep and broad domain of Teams more easily consumed.
